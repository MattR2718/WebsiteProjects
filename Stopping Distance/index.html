            <h1 class="info">SPEED</h1>
            <p class="info">The brakes of your car can only decelerate by a certain amount per second. This means the faster you’re driving, the longer it will take you to stop. </p>
            <h1 class="info">VIEW OF ROAD AHEAD</h1>
            <p class="info">Visibility is one of the factors that will inhibit your thinking distance. This is because the longer it takes you to spot hazards on the road, the more time will pass by before you are able to hit the brake pedal. </p>
            <h1 class="info">WEATHER</h1>
            <p class="info">Your stopping distance in the rain may be longer when roads are wet. This can even make your braking distance jump by double in wet conditions. Moreover, wet brakes can be less effective. Therefore, when it rains, ensure that you are using your brakes lightly but regularly so that they dry out.</p>
            <h1 class="info">TREAD</h1>
            <p class="info">The rule of thumb for the minimum legal tread depth is 1.6mm. However, it should be noted that the tread depth on your tyres can have a significant difference in your braking distance long before you actually reach this minimum. Most tyre lives begin with around 8mm of tread. This eventually wears away the more they are in use. As your tyre tread begins to decline, as does the tyres’ ability to grip the road.  </p>
